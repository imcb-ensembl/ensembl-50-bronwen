EXTERNAL_DB UPDATES
===================


DESCRIPTION
-----------

The external_db table contains a list of all external databases which are
referenced by ensembl.  Specifically this table is used by the xref table
which contains lists of external database identifiers.

Foremerly all EnsEMBL core databases had their own external_db tables
and used an enumeration of db_names.  This was difficult to maintain and
required schema updates every release.  The new system requires that 
every ensembl database contains the exact same external_db table, which
ensures consistancy across all databases and makes it easier to test.

MASTER EXTERNAL_DB LIST
-----------------------

The master list of external databases is stored in the file:

${ENSEMBL_HOME}/ensembl/misc-scripts/external_db/external_dbs.txt

This file contains a tab-seperated list of values which are loaded into
the external_db tables.  In order the columns are 'external_db_id', 'db_name',
'release', 'status'.  The release column is currently not used by the 
software and is always set to 1.  The status must be one of 'XREF', 'KNOWNXREF',
'KNOWN', 'PRED', 'ORTH', 'PSEUDO'.  This is used by the webcode to determine
which genes/transcripts can be considered to be known or unknown etc.

90	UMCU_Hsapiens_19Kv1	1	XREF
100	AFFY_HG_U133	1	XREF
110	AFFY_HG_U95	1	XREF
120	AFFY_MG_U74	1	XREF
130	AFFY_MG_U74v2	1	XREF
140	AFFY_Mu11Ksub	1	XREF
...


UPDATE PROCEDURE
----------------

The following describes the steps necessary to update the external_db table
and how to load new mart/GKB xrefs.

(1) Add new external database(s) if the appropriate database(s) are not in the
master list:
   (a) Add a row to the external_dbs.txt file.  The columns must be tab
       seperated and the external_db identifier must be unique.  The 
       release should be set to 1 and the status should reflect the 
       how xrefs from this external database are used by web.

       For example a new external_db 'AFFY_HG_U101' could be added as the 
       following:
       115	AFFY_HG_U101	1	XREF

   (b) Commit the external_dbs.txt file using cvs commit.  This is to 
       ensure that nobody else who may also be updating the file will use
       the same identifier that you chose (in the example ID 115).

   (c) Propagate the contents of the file to all of the release databases.
       If not all of the databases have yet arrived on the mysql instance
       then you will have to re-run the propogation script when they get there.
   
       The changes to the list can be applied to all of the databases by 
       running the script:
       ${ENSEMBL_HOME}/ensembl/misc-scripts/external_db/update_external_dbs.pl

       To update all of the core databases for release 14 (note that vega 
       may have to be applied seperately):

       perl update_external_dbs.pl -host ecs2d -file external_dbs.txt \
                                   -user ensadmin -pass secret -release 14

       To update the homo_sapiens_core_13_31 and mus_musculus_core_14_30 
       databases:

       perl update_external_dbs.pl -host ecs2d -file external_dbs.txt \
                                   -user ensadmin -pass secret -release 14

       Upon executing the script it will display a list of dbs that the updates
       will be applied and you will have to type 'yes' at a confirmation.

       If the databases to be updated contain rows that are not in the file, 
       a warning will be given and the database in question skipped.


(2) Add new mart or GKB xrefs.  This can be done using the following scripts
    and the appropriate input files from Damian / Imre. It is important to
    ensure that any new external databases have been added as described in
    step 1.

    ${ENSEMBL_HOME}/ensembl/misc-scripts/external_db/load_additional_human_affy_xrefs.pl
 
    ${ENSEMBL_HOME}/ensembl/misc-scripts/external_db/load_additional_human_gkb_xrefs.pl

    These scripts take database connection args for a single db and a filename.

    To load affy xrefs for the homo_sapiens db:

    perl load_additional_human_affy_xrefs.pl -host ecs2d -user ensadmin \
       -pass secret -port 3306 -dbname homo_sapiens_core_14_31 -file affy.txt
