This directory contains a set of tests for the Ensembl API
modules. The test_genome.zip file contains the set of data 
that is used by the tests.

The test system requires some modules which are in a seperate
CVS module ensembl-test.  To use the tests you must add the
ensembl-test modules to your PERL5LIB environment variable.

Example:

setenv PERL5LIB ${PERL5LIB}:${ENSHOME}/ensembl-test/modules

In order to run the tests you must create a t/MultiTestDB.conf
file with connection details (username, host, etc.) for a mysql
instance where you have write permission. An example file named
MultiTestDB.conf.example is included in the /t directory. 
Running test case(s) which require a database will 
automatically create and remove a temporary database during the 
test(s) execution.

To run multiple tests at once use the runtests.pl script 
which is found in the ensembl-test/scripts directory. It
may be useful to add this directory to your path.
To run a single test simply execute the .t file:

Examples:

# run all tests in the t directory
runtests.pl t

# run 3 tests
runtests.pl t/gene.t t/exon.t t/densityFeature.t

# run a single test
perl t/gene.t
