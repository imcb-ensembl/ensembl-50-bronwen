Note is no path is specifed the files mentioned live in 
ensembl-pipeline/test_system

To run the tests there a couple of things you must first do

First fill out the two conf files

TestDB.conf (an example is found at TestDB.conf.example) and
RefDB.conf (an example is found at RefDB.conf.example)

These files contain settings for where the test databases are to be created
whay sql files to use to load the table structures, where the directory
where the zip file all the data is in is located (the file itself is named
for the species you are running tests against). There are also other
settings to do with loaded data into the database and how long the RunTest
module should sleep for between checking if there are jobs running when
testing single analyses

When running the tests the perl5lib is modified to point at some prefilled
config files which live here

config/Bio/EnsEMBL/Pipeline/Config

Prior to running you will need to fill out these options

BatchQueue.pm, DEFAULT_OUTPUT_DIR


there are two different types of test

test_single_analysis.pl this takes a species and single logic_name
and uses the job_submission script to run that analyses then if the
correct options are specified the results are compared to the reference set
of data. The script reports how many jobs were sucessful what statuses the
jobs remaining in the pipeline have, how many results were produced etc

test_whole_pipeline.pl this uses the rule tables defined in the dump to
run the pipeline with RuleManager, This test will take longer to run as
it runs all the analyses for the specified species from start to finish


Currently there is data for testing the raw computes in human.
These are the analyses and modules which can be tested and the tables they
write their data to

RepeatMask      RepeatMasker     repeat_feature
Dust            Dust             repeat_feature
TRF             TRF              repeat_feature
Eponine         EponineTSS       simple_feature     
FirstEF         FirstEF          simple_feature
tRNAscan        tRNAscan_SE      simple_feature
CpG             CPG              simple_feature
Genscan         Genscan          prediction_transcript
Vertrna         BlastGenscanDNA  dna_align_feature
Unigene         BlastGenscanDNA  dna_align_feature
Swall           BlastGenscanPep  protein_align_feature
marker          EPCR             marker_feature

To run these tests individually you need a commandline like this

./test_single_analysis.pl -logic_name CpG -feature_table simple_feature

if you want the data compared to the reference data you all need to 
pass the commandline option -run_comparison

if you don't want the output files or databases deleted after the test is
run you can specify the -dont_cleanup option

If you run with the don't cleanup option the script should print out
commandlines for the cleanup
