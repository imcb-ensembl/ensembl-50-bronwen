2	Failed to match	Unable to match to any ensembl entity at all
3	Failed to match at thresholds	Unable to match at the thresholds of 90% for the query or 90% for the target
4	Low coverage	Coverage of the best alignment is less than 90% - see query_score for coverage
5	Low percent_id	Percentage identity of the best alignment is less than 97% - see query_score for percent_id
6	Processed pseudogene	Rejected as a processed pseudogene because there are multiple-exon hits with the same coverage which have been rejected for other reasons
7	All long introns	Every intron in these hits is of length 250000-400000bp, we require at least one intron to be shorter than 250000bp
8	Low coverage with long intron	Hits containing introns longer than 250000bp are rejected if coverage is less than 98% - see query_score for coverage
9	Low percent_id with long intron	Hits containing introns longer than 250000bp are rejected if percentage identity is less than 98% - see query_score for percent_id
10	>10% N-strings	More than 10% of the sequence consists of strings of 'N's. Sequences are not rejected for this reason but this may explain a low coverage hit
11	No output from Exonerate	Exonerate returned no hits using standard parameters plus options --maxintron 400000 and --softmasktarget FALSE
12	GSS sequence	This cDNA has been excluded from the analysis because it is in the GSS (Genome Survey Sequence) division of GenBank
13	See kill-list database	This sequence has been excluded from the analysis - see the kill-list database for further details
14	Failed to match at thresholds	Unable to match at the thresholds of 99% for the query or 99% for the target
15	Failed to match at thresholds	Unable to match at the thresholds of 100% for the query or 100% for the target
16	Failed to match at thresholds	Unable to match at the thresholds of 55% for the query or 55% for the target
17	Parent xref failed to match	Unable to match as parent xref was not mapped
18	Marker matches multiple times	Marker aligns to the genome > 5 times
19	Marker does not align	Unable to align to the genome
