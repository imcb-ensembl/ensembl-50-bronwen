======================================
**  CONVERTING WORMBASE TO ENSEMBL  **
======================================

this is the first attempt at a read-me

any questions email Laura Clarke at lec@sanger.ac.uk

wormbase_to_ensembl.pl (by Felix Kokocinski) will automate most steps - see
'(iii) Converting WormBase to Ensembl using wormbase_to_ensembl.pl' below.


===============================
(i) What you need to do this 
===============================

code
I am currently using ensembl and ensembl-pipeline main trunk and bioperl 0.7

data
the wormbase agp and gff files which can be found here
ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/wormbase/current_release/CHROMOSOMES


a fasta file of wormbase clones
ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/wormbase/sequences/ALL_COSMIDS/allcmid.gz


access to something like pfetch or srs to get the embl accessioned sequences in fasta format

a program which you can use to index the allcmid fasta file

preferably one which has a Bio::EnsEMBL::Pipeline::SeqFetcher modules for it

example are indicate by steve searle which uses

 Bio::EnsEMBL::Pipeline::SeqFetcher::OBDAIndexSeqFetcher;

and getseqs by james cuff which uses

 Bio::EnsEMBL::Pipeline::SeqFetcher::Getseqs;




=================================
(ii) How to run the process
=================================
get the required files from the ftp site

---

create a mysql database to hold the information

---

use the sql file in ensembl/sql for most tables
if you are going to run raw computes you also need ensembl-pipeline/sql

WormBase_analysis.sql to load the analysis table

mysql -hhost -uuser -ppass databasename < ensembl-pipeline/sql/WormBase_analysis.sql 


fill in the fields in WormBaseConf.pm

WB_CHR_INFO, this is an array of information about the chromosomes

there are four fields for each chromosome

chr_name, the name to be used in the chromosome table
agp_file, path to agp file
length , length of chromosome
gff_file, path to gff file

WB_NEW_COORD_SYSTEM_VERSION #used to be WB_AGP_TYPE

this is the agp type to be used in the assembly table and loaded into the meta table

WB_DBNAME, WB_DBHOST, WB_DBPASS, WB_DBUSER

information about database

WB_CLONE_INDEX

path to index to be used to get wormbase sequences by clone name

this is an anonymous array as the constructors for both the suggested seqfetchers take array refs to index locations

WB_LOGIC_NAME

the logic name in your analysis table to be used for wormbase genes

WB_DEBUG

if you want debug on

WB_SEQ_IDS, WB_NON_TRANSFORM, WB_NON_TRANSLATE

files to write problem areas info to 

WB_NEW_CONTIGS 

path to file to write data to be loaded into input_id_analysis table if you are running transfer_raw_computes.pl if you have a database with exisiting raw computes in

WB_SUBMIT_CONTIG_ID

the analysis id of the submit contig analysis in the analysis table if running the transfer_raw_compute.pl script

WB_RAW_COMPUTES

set this to 0 there aren't existing raw computes and it will put entries into the input_id_analysis table

---

run the script

the script to run is 

wormbase_to_ensembl.pl

if you have filled in all the fields in WormBaseConf correctly this should just run

for the whole genome it will probably take about 1/2 to an hour to run

the script goes through a series of processes

this process is looped for each chromosome

the first is to parse through the agp file to get all the embl accession of the clone in the agp

the sequences of each of the accessions is then fetched using pfetch, this is currently hardcoded in WormBase.pm as pfetch has the option to get archived sequences but this may change in the future

once the sequences have been fetched the agp is parsed properly and a hash is produced keyed on embl accession one line for each line in the assembly table

the lengths of the sequences that have been fetched are compared to the lengths claimed by the agp, if they are different

the clone name for the embl accession is got from Clone2Acc.pm which should be in the same directory as this read me and it contains a mapping of embl accessions to clone names

if thats not there or appears to be wrong the place to try is 

wormbase-help@wormbase.org

once the correct sequences have been found each clone and the required line from the agp are loaded into the database


once the sequences have been loaded into the database the script should parse the genes from the gff file

the process also have many steps

the curated CDS lines are parsed out of the gff as these describe the coords of the exons and their start frame

the files contain frame but ensembl uses phase, these are two different values to determine which base is used to start the translation of a exon

they can be interchanged using this sum

my $phase = (3 - $frame)%3;

first a hash keyed on transcript_id(clonename.number(letter)) of the lines in the file for that transcript is produced

this hash is taken and the lines are taken and turned into Bio::EnsEMBL::Exons

end_phase is calculated on the basis of start phase and length of exon


once the exons have been created they are pieced together into transcripts

the transcripts are then collected together into genes

the genes are transformed into raw contig coordinates

any genes which don't transform their ids are written to a file

all the genes which transform are then stored

once all the genes have been stored the genes translations are checked

the genes which don't translate

the sequence of the clone they are on is got from the wormbase sequence index and loaded into the database

the location of the exons and the assembly is changed to reflect the new contig

the translation is checked again if it still doesn't translate the id is written to a file so it can be further investigated

--------------
 Raw computes
--------------

If you haven't already got any raw computes set WB_RAW_COMPUTES 0 it will fill the input_id_analysis table then provided you have the rule and analysis tables set up correctly you shuld just have to run the RuleManager3.pl script

if you already have existing raw computes you need to run transfer_raw_computes to put them into the new database then run rule manager on the new contigs if there are any

-------------
 Data Checks
-------------

follow the ensembl-docs/post_genebuild_checks.txt to check the data

(iii) Converting WormBase to Ensembl using wormbase_to_ensembl.pl
================================================================

1. Preparation
--------------
Check your PERL5LIB.

Make sure that you have a large enough $workDIR and $scratchDIR.

Set up your own CVS dir like $cvsDIR/ensembl-config/celegans/WB150/

Check the variables in:
-  wormbase_to_ensembl.pl 
-  WormBaseConf.pm 
-  $cvsDIR/ensembl-config/celegans/WB150/Bio/Ensembl/Pipeline/Config/BatchQueue.pm
   etc


2. Known problems
------------------
-  Wormbase team may change the format of their files, in which case parsing needs to be updated.

-  Check that the .agp and .gff files are in sync or you will get genes with frameshifts (unable to translate)
   Check that clone version is most recent

-  There is one Selenocysteine (U) gene, C06G3.7. The script should handle this.   

-  Manually change the information for SNAP in the analysis table:
   eg. update analysis set db_file = '/usr/local/ensembl/Zoe/HMM/worm' where analysis.analysis_id = 20;

-  clone:CEL150:AF067617.1:1:28678:1 -> the SNAP will not run as genscan and ensembl produce slightly
   different peptides due to a run of N's. 
   Genscan = CGVADVETVNDSDSEDKKDMAAVAAAQAQFLRLXXXXXXXXXXAAVAASSSASRKASRKRPNNDNDAKMRAMQQMLMGQG
   Ensembl = CGVADVETVNDSDSEDKKDMAAVAAAQAQFLRXXXXXXXXXXAAAVAASSSASRKASRKRPNNDNDAKMRAMQQMLMGQG
   This can be fixed by altering the subroutine in BaseAbInitio.pm, subsitute_x_codes().
   Also, the terminal * is not removed from the genscan model in this case. 
   
-  xrefs may need to be run manually
