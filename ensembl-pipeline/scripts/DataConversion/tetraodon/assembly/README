The Tetraodon assembly (version 7) comprises chromsomes, ultracontigs
and scaffolds (the last of which are the lowest-level contigs of
sequence made available). To load it into Ensembl, we need:

(1) a fasta file containing the scaffolds.

(2) An agp describing the relationship between the chromosomes and
scaffolds.  

(3) An agp describing the relationship between the ultracontigs and
scaffolds. 

Item (1) is supplied. The information for item (2) is supplied, but
needs to be formatted into correct 'agp' format for use by the loadinf
scripts. This can be done with convert_to_agp.pl:

convert_to_agp.pl Genoscope_agp_file > chromosome.agp

Item (3) can now be derived from the chromsome agp using
extract_ultracontigs.pl: 

extract_ultracontigs.pl chromosome.agp > ultracontigs.agp

You are now ready to load your sequence and assembly into Ensembl.
