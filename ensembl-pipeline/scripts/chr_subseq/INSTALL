Compilation and installation instructions
=========================================

1)  Set the CC and CFLAGS environment variables to something sensible.
    The following should work on most systems:

    setenv CC cc
    setenv CFLAGS -O2

    or if you're using a bourne shell:

    CC=cc; CFLAGS=-O2; export CC CFLAGS

2)  make

3)  Copy the chr_subseq binary to a location on your PATH, so that the
    Ensembl pipeline code can find it.
